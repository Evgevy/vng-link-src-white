            p.selected__text With the intelligent development of industry, the intelligence of equipment also determines the precision of the processing effect. In particular, the micro devices required in the fields of optoelectronics, microelectronics, etc., as well as the large optoelectronic devices and ultra-precision processing equipment required in the aerospace, aviation and other fields, have put forward higher requirements for intelligence and automation. The use of intelligent equipment can improve processing stability and reduce the dependence of processing results on manual experience. <br><br>Therefore, the demand for high-precision intelligent CNC processing equipment is increasing day by day. On the contrary, traditional machine tools with low efficiency and poor stability will gradually be eliminated by the market! This also gives opportunities to some serious equipment manufacturers in the market. It is imperative for Chinese equipment manufacturers to upgrade!<br><br>Mechanical processing refers to the process of changing the dimensions or properties of a workpiece through a mechanical device. According to the difference in processing methods, it can be divided into cutting processing and pressure processing. The mechanical equipment required for processing includes digital display, CNC milling machine, form grinder, lathe, EDM machine, universal grinder, machining center, laser welding machine, wire cutting equipment (medium wire cutting, fast wire cutting, slow wire cutting), cylindrical grinder , internal cylindrical grinders, precision lathes, etc., which can perform turning, milling, planing, grinding, drilling, electrical discharge machining and other processing methods of precision parts. With the rapid development of modern machining, machining technology has developed rapidly, and many advanced machining technology methods have slowly emerged, such as micro machining technology, rapid prototyping technology, precision and ultra-precision machining technology, etc.<br><br>Our country has become a major manufacturing country of mechanical equipment parts with complete categories, large scale, solid foundation and strong competitiveness. There are more than 3,000 enterprises above designated size in the whole industry, including more than 500 major backbone enterprises. It has formed a certain international competitiveness. With a complete machinery and equipment parts industry system, many advantaged companies have gone abroad to invest and build factories overseas to provide face-to-face services to downstream customers. Following the direction of the market, Shanghai ANTS Machine Equipment Co., Ltd. has exported thousands of sets of various types of mechanical processing equipment and metal forming equipment to countries along the Belt and Road, neighboring countries in Southeast Asia and the CIS countries, effectively expanding its market. The goal of China’s high-end machine tools going global! <br><br>The current situation of the mechanical parts processing industry is that the supply is in short supply, but the quality cannot be ignored in pursuit of quantity. The current mechanical parts processing needs to meet the three characteristics of shape accuracy, dimensional accuracy, and position accuracy in order to meet market demand and maintain a continuous development state. At present, there is still a lot of room for development in my country’s mechanical parts processing, and the mechanical parts processing industry cannot fully meet the needs of the market in terms of technology and demand.
